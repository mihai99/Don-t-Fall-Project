# Don’t Fall
## Blaga Mihai Andrei, Grupa B1
Don’t fall is the type of mobile game in which you have to complete a series of levels in order to win. The levels are filled with different obstacles that will kill you. You have 3 lives and when you lose all you have to restart the game. You also can buy powerups from the shop. You make money by completing levels and finding stars or diamonds.
The core gameplay of the game consists in avoiding traps and finishing levels in the fastest time. Traps are of different type: spikes that raise from the ground, axes that swing, cannons, teleports, blocks of the map that fall when you step on them, hammers and also spikes that fall from the sky, and the only way you see them is by shadow or remembering the timing and the place of them. The tutorial shows the player the basics of the game, but most of the part is left for the player to discover the first time they die, There is also the idea of implementing a multiplayer part where you can play vs someone else, on a selected level.
